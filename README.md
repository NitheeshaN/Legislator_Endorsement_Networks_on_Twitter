Abstract:
Much of the extant literature on political endorsements focuses on celebrity endorsements or news media endorsements on outcomes of general elections. The literature on political elite endorsements mostly study behaviors at the federal level, such as Presidents, governors, or party leaders. Most of these studies find that endorsements are conducive to electoral success, making endorsements a powerful political tool. Considering this fact, it is important to examine eliteâ€™s endorsement behavior at the subnational level. Who elites decide to throw their support towards has significant implications for the who takes political office. This in turn effects levels of descriptive representation. And descriptive representation at the state legislative level is necessary considering the implications of state legislative decisions on citizens daily lives. Yet there is a significant gap in the literature concerning patterns of endorsement of state legislators.
